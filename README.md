OpenMotorFW
OpenMotorFW is a modular, open-source motor controller firmware platform designed to be the "Linux of motor firmware."

Our mission is to provide a flexible, secure, and extensible foundation for controlling a wide range of electric motors across industrial, consumer, and embedded applications.

Key Features
Modular architecture: Easily customize and extend for different motor types and use cases.

Edge AI integration: Real-time fault detection, predictive maintenance, and intelligent control.

Secure boot & firmware updates: Strong security for critical motor control systems.

Multi-protocol support: MQTT, UART, BLE, HTTP for versatile connectivity.

Cross-platform compatibility: Support for STM32, ESP32, TI MCUs, and more.

Comprehensive documentation: Designed to be accessible and a gold standard for open-source motor firmware projects.

Current Status
Early development phase.

Core modules and documentation underway.

Private repository for now; will be made public once foundational work stabilizes.

Next Steps
Expand core motor control modules.

Develop AI-powered diagnostics.

Build community engagement and contribution guidelines.
